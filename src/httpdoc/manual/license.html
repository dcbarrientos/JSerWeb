            <p class="contenido"> Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, 
              Inc. 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA Everyone 
              is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license 
              document, but changing it is not allowed.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>Preamble</b></p>
            <p class="contenido"> The licenses for most software are designed 
              to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the 
              GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom 
              to share and change free software--to make sure the software is 
              free for all its users. This<br>
              General Public License applies to most of the Free Software Foundation's 
              software and to any other program whose authors commit to<br>
              using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered 
              by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply 
              it to your programs, too.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> When we speak of free software, we are referring 
              to freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are designed 
              to make sure that you<br>
              have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge 
              for this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can 
              get it<br>
              if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of 
              it in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions 
              that forbid anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender 
              the rights.<br>
              These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you 
              if you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> For example, if you distribute copies of such 
              a program, whether gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients 
              all the rights that<br>
              you have. You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get 
              the source code. And you must show them these terms so they know 
              their rights.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright 
              the software, and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal 
              permission to copy,<br>
              distribute and/or modify the software. </p>
            <p class="contenido"> Also, for each author's protection and ours, 
              we want to make certain that everyone understands that there is 
              no warranty for this free software. If the software is modified 
              by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to know that 
              what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced 
              by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> Finally, any free program is threatened constantly 
              by software patents. We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors 
              of a free program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect 
              making the program proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it 
              clear that any patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or 
              not licensed at all.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> The precise terms and conditions for copying, 
              distribution and modification follow.</p>
            <p class="contenido"><br>
              GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE<br>
              TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>0.</b> This License applies to any program 
              or other work which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder 
              saying it may be distributed under the terms of this General Public 
              License. The &quot;Program&quot;, below, refers to any such program 
              or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot; means either 
              the Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is 
              to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it, either 
              verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another language. 
              (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the 
              term &quot;modification&quot;.) Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> Activities other than copying, distribution 
              and modification are not covered by this License; they are outside 
              its scope. The act of running the Program is not restricted, and 
              the output from the Program is covered only if its contents constitute 
              a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by 
              running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the Program 
              does.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>1.</b> You may copy and distribute verbatim 
              copies of the Program's source code as you receive it, in any medium, 
              provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each 
              copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; 
              keep intact all the notices that refer to this License and to the 
              absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program 
              a copy of this License along with the Program.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> You may charge a fee for the physical act of 
              transferring a copy, and you may at your option offer warranty protection 
              in exchange for a fee.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>2.</b> You may modify your copy or copies 
              of the Program or any portion of it, thus forming a work based on 
              the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications or work 
              under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet 
              all of these conditions:</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>a)</b> You must cause the modified files 
              to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the files and 
              the date of any change.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>b)</b> You must cause any work that you distribute 
              or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is derived from 
              the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no 
              charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>c)</b> If the modified program normally reads 
              commands interactively when run, you must cause it, when started 
              running for such interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print 
              or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice 
              and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you 
              provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program 
              under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy 
              of this License. (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive 
              but does not normally print such an announcement, your work based 
              on the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</p>
            <p class="contenido"><br>
              These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable 
              sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can 
              be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves, 
              then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections 
              when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute 
              the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the 
              Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of this 
              License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire 
              whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> Thus, it is not the intent of this section to 
              claim rights or contest your rights to work written entirely by 
              you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the 
              distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Program.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> In addition, mere aggregation of another work 
              not based on the Program with the Program (or with a work based

              does not bring the other work under the scope of this License.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>3.</b> You may copy and distribute the Program 
              (or a work based on it, under Section 2) in object code or executable 
              form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you 
              also do one of the following:</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>a)</b> Accompany it with the complete corresponding 
              machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the 
              terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for 
              software interchange; or,</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>b)</b> Accompany it with a written offer, 
              valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for a charge 
              no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution, 
              a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, 
              to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a 
              medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>c)</b> Accompany it with the information 
              you received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source 
              code. (This alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution 
              and only if you received the program in object code or executable 
              form with such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</p>
            <p class="contenido"> The source code for a work means the preferred 
              form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable 
              work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules 
              it contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus 
              the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the 
              executable. However, as a special exception, the source code distributed 
              need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either 
              source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, 
              and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, 
              unless that component itself accompanies the executable.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> If distribution of executable or object code 
              is made by offering access to copy from a designated place, then 
              offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same 
              place counts as distribution of the source code, even though third 
              parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object 
              code.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>4.</b> You may not copy, modify, sublicense, 
              or distribute the Program except as expressly provided under this 
              License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute 
              the Program is void, and will automatically terminate your rights 
              under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or 
              rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses 
              terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>5.</b> You are not required to accept this 
              License, since you have not signed it. However, nothing else grants 
              you permission to modify or distribute the Program or its derivative 
              works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept 
              this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program 
              (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance 
              of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, 
              distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>6.</b> Each time you redistribute the Program 
              (or any work based on the Program), the recipient automatically 
              receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute 
              or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions. You 
              may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise 
              of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing 
              compliance by third parties to this License.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>7.</b> If, as a consequence of a court judgment 
              or allegation of patent infringement or for any other reason (not 
              limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether 
              by court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions 
              of this License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this 
              License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously 
              your obligations under this License and any other pertinent obligations, 
              then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all. 
              For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution 
              of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly 
              through you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this 
              License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> If any portion of this section is held invalid 
              or unenforceable under any particular circumstance, the balance 
              of the section is intended to apply and the section as a whole is 
              intended to apply in other circumstances.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> It is not the purpose of this section to induce 
              you to infringe any patents or other property right claims or to 
              contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole purpose 
              of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system, 
              which is implemented by public license practices. Many people have 
              made generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed 
              through that system in reliance on consistent application of that 
              system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing 
              to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot 
              impose that choice.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> This section is intended to make thoroughly 
              clear what is believed to be a consequence of the rest of this License.</p>

              the Program is restricted in certain countries either by patents 
              or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who 
              places the Program under this License may add an explicit geographical 
              distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that distribution 
              is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such 
              case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in 
              the body of this License.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>9.</b> The Free Software Foundation may publish 
              revised and/or new versions of the General Public License from time 
              to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present 
              version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> Each version is given a distinguishing version 
              number. If the Program specifies a version number of this License 
              which applies to it and &quot;any later version&quot;, you have 
              the option of following the terms and conditions either of that 
              version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. 
              If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, 
              you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> <b>10.</b> If you wish to incorporate parts

              which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the 
              Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. 
              Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free 
              status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting

              How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</p>
            <p class="contenido"> If you develop a new program, and you want it 
              to be of the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to 
              achieve this is to make it free software which everyone can redistribute 
              and change under these terms.</p>
            <p class="contenido"> To do so, attach the following notices to the 
              program. It is safest to attach them to the start of each source 
              file to most effectively convey the exclusion of warranty; and each 
              file should have at least the &quot;copyright&quot; line and a pointer 
              to where the full notice is found.</p>
